- ðŸ“¢ **2022/03** -- Our paper "Representational Continuity for Unsupervised Continual Learning" got accepted to ICLR 2022 (Oral presentation)!
- ðŸ“¢ **2021/12** -- Our paper "ReMoS: Reducing Defect Inheritance in Transfer Learning via Relevant Model Slicing" is accepted to ICSE 2022. It discusses the defect inheritance problem during transfer learning. I believe the security of pretrained models is an important problem since pretraining is increaingly popular.
- ðŸ“¢ **2021/11** -- I recently left MSRA and joined the Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR) at Tsinghua University as a Research Assistant Professor. Many thanks to my mentors and colleagues at MSRA.
