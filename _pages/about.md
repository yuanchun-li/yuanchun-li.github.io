I am a Research Assistant Professor at the [Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR)](http://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm). I received a Ph.D. degree and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, both from [Peking University](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/English/Home.htm). I had also worked as a Visiting PhD Student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://hcii.cmu.edu/). Before joining AIR, I was a Senior Researcher in the [Systems Research Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-and-networking-research-group-asia/) at [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](https://www.msra.cn/).

My research interests can be summarized as **intelligent systems software**, which includes the following two aspects:
- **Systems and software supports for AI** - Building systems and tools to improve AI, including its reliability, privacy, and efficiency.
- **AI for fundamental software and systems** - Revolutionalizing today's systems and software with AI, such as program synthesis, automated testing, and self-organized systems.

Iâ€™ve published more than 20 research papers in premier venues such as ICSE, FSE, ISSTA, SIGIR, UbiComp, and MobiCom, including a best paper nomination in UbiComp 2016 and a best paper in IS-EUD 2017. Some of the papers have become popular open-source tools ([DroidBot](https://github.com/honeynet/droidbot/), [PrivacyStreams](https://github.com/PrivacyStreams/), [Humanoid](https://github.com/yzygitzh/Humanoid), etc.) in the area.

## News

- ðŸ“¢ **2021/12** -- Our paper "ReMoS: Reducing Defect Inheritance in Transfer Learning via Relevant Model Slicing" is accepted to ICSE 2022. It discusses the defect inheritance problem during transfer learning. I believe the security of pretrained models is an important problem since pretraining is increaingly popular.
- ðŸ“¢ **2021/11** -- I recently left MSRA and joined the Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR) at Tsinghua University as a Research Assistant Professor. Many thanks to my mentors and colleagues at MSRA.
