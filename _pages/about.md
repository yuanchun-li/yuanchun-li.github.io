I am a Research Assistant Professor at the [Institute for AI Industry Research (AIR)](http://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm). I received a Ph.D. degree and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, both from [Peking University](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/English/Home.htm). I had also worked as a Visiting PhD Student at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://hcii.cmu.edu/). Before joining AIR, I was a Senior Researcher in the [Systems Research Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/systems-and-networking-research-group-asia/) at [Microsoft Research Asia (MSRA)](https://www.msra.cn/).

My current research interests can be summarized as **Edge AI**, which includes the following two aspects:
- **Edge AI Efficiency** - Building systems to improve the efficiency of AI models, or designing AI models that can run efficiently at the edge.
- **Edge AI Reliability** - Improving the reliability of AI models deployed at the edge, by making them more robust, generalizable, and privacy-preserving.

I‚Äôve published in premier venues of mobile computing, artificial intelligence, and software engineering, including a best paper nomination in UbiComp 2016 and a best paper in IS-EUD 2017. Some of the papers have become popular open-source tools ([DroidBot](https://github.com/honeynet/droidbot/), [PrivacyStreams](https://github.com/PrivacyStreams/), [Humanoid](https://github.com/yzygitzh/Humanoid), etc.) in the area.
